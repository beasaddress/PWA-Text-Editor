## Description
This is a text editor that runs in the browser but since it meets PWA criteria, it can also run as a n installed application from your desktop. This application features data persistence techniques so that a user can use it offline as well. Users can take and save notes and will be ensured that the notes will be saved in IndexedDB so that if they close and re-open their app, their previous notes were saved, retrieved from the database, and displayed to the user. 

## Installations
Project dependencies are codemirror library, express, idb, and is-env.

## Usage
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Gitbash, and Heroku.
